# CLAUDE.md

DGIPR Marathi Content Platform — a Marathi-first system that turns official notes
into publication-ready Marathi **articles** and matching **posters**, using
historical Mahasamvad articles as style references.

**This file is the map. Trust it: open the named files directly instead of
re-scanning the whole monorepo to rebuild context.** It only needs updating when
the architecture or commands below change.

Product goals, principles, and the hard rules live in AGENTS.md, imported here:

## Monorepo layout

pnpm workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`); packages are referenced as `@dgipr/*`.

| Path | Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | `@dgipr/web` | Next.js (App Router) Marathi-first UI |
| `apps/api` | `@dgipr/api` | Fastify API — thin routes + job orchestration |
| `packages/content-engine` | `@dgipr/content-engine` | Scraping, chunking, embeddings, RAG, article generation + revision |
| `packages/poster-renderer` | `@dgipr/poster-renderer` | Poster: AI background photo + HTML/Chromium typesetting |
| `packages/database` | `@dgipr/database` | Supabase client, queries, storage helpers, row types |
| `packages/schemas` | `@dgipr/schemas` | Shared Zod schemas + types (poster `Copy`, generation API) |
| `supabase/migrations` | — | SQL migrations (pgvector + generations) |
| `n8n/workflow-exports` | — | Committed n8n workflow JSON (`social-post-v2-api.json` twitter path; `article-poster-v1-api.json` article poster — import targets for AWS) |
| `docs` | — | Project docs (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `web-scraping-context.md`) |

## Where things live (jump straight here)

**Generation flow (backend):**
- Fastify boot / CORS / error handler / `/health` → `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- HTTP routes under `/api/generations` (thin) → `apps/api/src/routes/generations.ts`
- Job orchestration + sequencing (the real pipeline) → `apps/api/src/jobs/runner.ts`
  - `startGenerationJob`: retrieve → `generateArticle` → (if poster) `generateCopy`
    → render poster → upload PNG(s) to Supabase Storage. The poster render forks on
    `ARTICLE_POSTER_MODE` (default `n8n`): `n8n` sends `{ headline, scene_brief,
    reference_url }` to the `article-poster-v1-api` webhook (`renderArticlePosterViaN8n`;
    `reference_url` = the pinned image, else a random enabled article master), which
    paints the whole landscape poster incl. the headline by editing that master — no
    scene image, no scenePath; `html` is the original `buildArticleScenePrompt`+
    `generateImage`+`generateArticlePoster` Chromium path (kept as fallback). Job state
    of record is the `generations` row (status/step/error), so polling clients survive
    refreshes.
  - `startSocialPostJob` sends the note plus the full reference-type catalog
    (`types` built by `buildTwitterCatalog`; `forced_type`/`forced_reference_url`
    non-empty when the run pinned an image or a whole type) to `social-post-v2-api`.
  - `startArticleFeedbackJob`, `startPosterFeedbackJob` (`copy` re-renders with the
    **cached** scene; `scene` regenerates the background image).
- Article gen / coverage / faithfulness / revisions →
  `packages/content-engine/src/generation/*`
  (`generate-article.ts`, `verify-coverage.ts`, `generate-copy.ts`, `revise-*.ts`,
  `openai-chat.ts`; category-aware prompting in `category-prompt.ts`)
- RAG + ingestion → `packages/content-engine/src/{retrieval,embedding,chunking,scraping}/*`
- Poster rendering → `packages/poster-renderer/src/*`
  (`generate-article-poster.ts`, `build-scene-prompt.ts`, `openai-image.ts`,
  `article-template.ts` / `poster-template.ts`, `render-html.ts`); public API in
  `packages/poster-renderer/src/index.ts`
- Reference templates (type catalog + image rotation + per-run catalog for n8n) →
  `packages/content-engine/src/references/*` (`reference-types.ts`,
  `reference-images.ts`, `catalog.ts`); routes → `apps/api/src/routes/references.ts`;
  web page → `apps/web/app/references/page.tsx`; home-page pin picker →
  `apps/web/components/ReferencePicker.tsx`
- DB access + Storage → `packages/database/src/*`
  (`client.ts`, `generations.ts`, `reference-types.ts`, `reference-images.ts`,
  `mahasamvad-chunks.ts`, `storage.ts`)
- Shared types/schemas → `packages/schemas/src/*` (`copy.ts`, `api.ts`)
- content-engine public API barrel → `packages/content-engine/src/index.ts`

**Web flow (user journey starts here):**
- Entry / create a generation → `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
- Generation detail (progress, article, poster, feedback) →
  `apps/web/app/generations/[id]/page.tsx`; history list →
  `apps/web/app/generations/page.tsx`
- Data layer → `apps/web/lib/api.ts`, `apps/web/lib/useGeneration.ts` (polling hook)
- Marathi UI strings → `apps/web/lib/strings.ts`
- UI components → `apps/web/components/*` (`ArticleView`, `PosterPanel`,
  `ProgressSteps`, `FeedbackBox`, `CopyEditForm`, `HistoryCard`, `StatusChip`)

**Data & schema:** `supabase/migrations/0001…0004_*.sql` — pgvector Mahasamvad
chunks, `generations` table, generation category + chunk style-category columns;
`0012`/`0013`/`0015` — reference-image library + `reference_types` catalog
(rotation semantics, exact-image and whole-type generation pins).

**Aux / not on the main request path:**
- `packages/content-engine/src/finetune/*` — reusable JSONL dataset pipeline
  (build-corpus/dataset, eval); OpenAI self-serve fine-tuning is currently
  unavailable, so this is data prep only.
- `packages/content-engine/src/generation/{polish-article,sarvam-chat,news-exemplar}.ts`
  — alternate/experimental generation paths (Sarvam polish, news few-shot).

## Commands

Run from repo root unless noted. Node 22+, pnpm 10+.

```bash
pnpm dev            # web on :3000 + api on :3001 (parallel)
pnpm dev:web        # web only
pnpm dev:api        # api only
pnpm build          # build all packages
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit across the workspace
pnpm lint
pnpm format         # prettier --write
pnpm n8n:push       # ship n8n/workflow-exports/*.json to a running n8n (see below)
```

`pnpm n8n:push [--dry-run] [--only=<name>] [--create]` (`n8n/push-workflows.mjs`) is the
**only** way workflow changes reach a running n8n — see the gotcha below. It needs
`N8N_API_URL` + `N8N_API_KEY` in the root `.env` (key: n8n editor → Settings → n8n API).

Content pipeline (from `packages/content-engine`, e.g.
`pnpm --filter @dgipr/content-engine scrape:news`):
`scrape:news` / `chunk:news` / `embed:news` (WordPress-REST ingest → chunk →
embed to pgvector), plus `:karjamukti` variants; `retrieve:test`,
`generate:test`, `polish:test`.

Poster preview (renders sample posters without the API):
`pnpm --filter @dgipr/poster-renderer poster:preview` and `poster:preview:article`.

One-time per machine (the API process renders posters too, so it needs a local
Chromium): `pnpm --filter @dgipr/poster-renderer exec playwright install chromium`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Marathi-first.** Never round-trip Marathi content through English. Names,
  dates, amounts, designations, scheme names, and locations are never invented —
  the user's note/uploaded docs are the only factual source; Mahasamvad articles
  are **style/structure references only**.
- **Completeness is tiered, not total — and tiers are citizen-first.** Foreground/supporting
  facts must be preserved; mention-tier detail may be compressed to a clause and omit-tier
  noise (committee rosters, accounting heads) dropped — editorial selection is a feature, not
  a bug. The brief assigns tiers by who a fact serves (benefits/eligibility/deadlines/citizen
  actions outrank implementation machinery; see `CATEGORY_TIER_GUIDANCE` in
  `editorial-brief.ts`), a tier-audit pass corrects mis-tiers, and the coverage loop enforces
  both sides (missing foreground/supporting + over-expanded mention/omit). "Never invent
  names/dates/amounts/designations/scheme names/locations" stays absolute; the faithfulness
  pass + fact-check appendix are the guard.
- **Package boundaries.** `apps/api` routes stay thin and only sequence calls +
  persist state; all LLM/render logic lives in `@dgipr/content-engine` and
  `@dgipr/poster-renderer`. Keep it that way.
- **Posters (HTML path):** in `ARTICLE_POSTER_MODE=html` the model paints a **text-free**
  photo and all Devanagari text, header, and footer are typeset in HTML and screenshotted
  with Chromium (this is what prevents garbled Marathi). Storage paths are versioned per
  render (public bucket is CDN-cached — never reuse a path).
- **Article poster via n8n (default).** With `ARTICLE_POSTER_MODE=n8n` the article poster
  is rendered by the `article-poster-v1-api` workflow, not Chromium: the API sends only
  `{ headline, scene_brief, reference_url }` and the image model paints the whole
  **landscape** poster (one Marathi headline, no bullets/stats — deliberately simple,
  distinct from the Twitter posters) by editing the master at `reference_url`. This
  intentionally accepts image-model Devanagari for the single headline (verified
  acceptable). No scene image is produced, so poster feedback + manual copy-edit (which
  need `scenePath`) are unavailable in this mode.
- **Reference templates are a data-driven catalog, not a fixed list.** `reference_types`
  (migration 0013) holds the six builtins plus user-created custom twitter types; each
  type has a rotation of immutable library images (`reference_images`, many may be
  enabled at once, one picked at random per run) managed on `/references`. The home form
  can pin either one exact image (`generations.reference_image_id`) or a whole Twitter
  type (`generations.reference_type_id`). Both skip classification and force the type;
  a type pin still rolls one of that type's enabled images afresh per run. Custom-type
  slugs are server-generated
  (`custom_` + 8 hex) because they feed OpenAI json_schema enums + storage paths; custom
  copy uses the `generic` layout. If nothing is enabled in a category, the job fails
  with a Marathi error shown raw in the UI.
- **Editing a workflow JSON does not deploy it.** n8n keeps workflows in its own database
  (the `n8n_data` volume on the EC2 box); it never reads `n8n/workflow-exports/*.json` from
  disk. `git pull` + `docker compose up -d --build` on the host rebuilds only the **api**
  image, so the hosted workflows stay on whatever was last imported. Ship workflow changes
  with `pnpm n8n:push` (after deploying the API — the workflows need the API's newer payload
  fields). Two more traps the script exists to handle: the exports carry no `id` (a plain
  import creates duplicates that then collide on the webhook path), and credential ids +
  the Webhook node's Header Auth are instance-specific — the script re-binds them by name
  off the live workflow so a push can't unbind OpenAI or disable `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- **The n8n MCP points at the LOCAL n8n** (`http://localhost:5678`), not the hosted one.
  Workflow ids seen through it (`1emSaqFmkLRUubUM`, `J4UTtNt2KMxuDSKf`) are local-dev ids
  and are meaningless on `n8n.indicex.xyz`. Never treat an MCP publish as a prod deploy.
- **n8n workflows are host-independent.** They no longer hardcode master URLs: the API
  sends the full type catalog (with immutable `references/library/...` public URLs) in
  every webhook payload, and the workflows fetch those over HTTPS — never local disk.
  The legacy canonical `references/master-*.png` objects remain in Storage only as seed
  data for `pnpm --filter @dgipr/content-engine seed:reference-library`. Deploy
  artifacts: `n8n/workflow-exports/{social-post-v2-api,article-poster-v1-api}.json` —
  import both into the AWS n8n (deploy the API first; the reworked workflows need the
  catalog fields in the payload).
- **All OpenAI traffic goes through `packages/content-engine/src/http/openai-request.ts`**
  (`openAiFetch`) — never `fetch` `api.openai.com` directly. It serializes calls process-wide
  (`OPENAI_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, default 1) and retries 429/5xx using the wait OpenAI names in its
  `retry-after` / `x-ratelimit-reset-*` headers. One article is 8-15 gpt-4o calls of ~5-8k
  tokens each, so on a 30k-TPM org concurrency > 1 reliably 429s; a `429 insufficient_quota`
  (billing, not rate) fails fast instead of backing off. Retry warnings in the log are the
  mechanism working, not a fault. `poster-renderer`'s image call and `sarvam-chat.ts` are not
  yet covered.
- **Env & secrets:** config comes from the root `.env` (see `.env.example`:
  Supabase + OpenAI, optional Sarvam). Never commit secrets.
- **Scraped output** under `packages/content-engine/data/` is gitignored — don't
  commit it or assume it's present.
