# AGENTS.md

This file is the persistent project memory for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Goal

Build the **DGIPR Marathi Content Platform**, a Marathi-first content system for government communication teams.

The long-term product will:

- ingest meeting notes, government resolutions, press notes, and scheme information
- preserve official documents as the factual source of truth
- reuse historical Mahasamvad articles as style and structure references
- generate publication-ready Marathi articles and matching Marathi posters
- support future validation, RAG retrieval, poster generation, and Canva integration

## Current Phase

Scaffolding is done. The core generation pipeline and a first web product on top of
it are implemented and working end-to-end:

- Mahasamvad scraping/ingestion, chunking, embeddings, and RAG retrieval
  (`packages/content-engine/src/{scraping,chunking,embedding,retrieval}`)
- Article generation with coverage + faithfulness verification
  (`packages/content-engine/src/generation/generate-article.ts`)
- Poster generation: a text-free AI background photo, typeset in HTML and
  screenshotted with Chromium so Devanagari is never mangled
  (`packages/poster-renderer`)
- Feedback/revision loops for the article and poster text/scene
  (`packages/content-engine/src/generation/revise-*.ts`)
- A Fastify API (`apps/api`) exposing generation, feedback, and poster-edit
  endpoints under `/api/generations`, backed by Supabase tables
  (`supabase/migrations/0002_generations.sql`) and a public Storage bucket for
  poster/scene PNGs
- A Marathi-first Next.js frontend (`apps/web`) for non-technical government
  staff: create a generation, watch progress, edit poster text, send feedback,
  and browse history

Not implemented yet: Canva integration, n8n workflows, authentication.

## Planned Architecture

- `apps/web`: Next.js frontend application
- `apps/api`: Fastify backend API
- `packages/content-engine`: document processing, AI, RAG, article generation, and revision logic
- `packages/database`: Supabase queries, database helpers, and database types
- `packages/schemas`: shared Zod schemas and TypeScript types (poster copy + generation API)
- `packages/poster-renderer`: poster-generation logic (Canva integration still future)
- `supabase/migrations`: SQL migrations
- `n8n/workflow-exports`: future exported n8n workflows
- `docs`: project documentation

## Product Principles

- Marathi must remain the primary content language.
- Do not translate Marathi source content into English and back unless explicitly required.
- Existing Mahasamvad articles are primarily style and structure references.
- New notes and uploaded official documents are the factual source of truth for new content.
- Names, dates, amounts, designations, scheme names, and locations must never be invented.
- Core business logic must remain modular, testable, version-controlled, and stored in code.
- n8n may later be used for scheduling, notifications, retries, and automation, but the main business logic must not live inside large n8n workflows.
- Secrets, API keys, and credentials must never be committed to the repository.

## Required Rules For Future Agents

1. Every future AI agent must read this `AGENTS.md` file before making changes.
2. `AGENTS.md` must be updated whenever a major architectural decision or implementation milestone changes.

## Development Expectations

- Preserve useful existing files and configuration.
- Prefer shared, reusable code over one-off logic.
- Keep implementation boundaries clear: `apps/api` routes stay thin; LLM/rendering
  logic lives in `packages/content-engine` and `packages/poster-renderer`; `apps/api`
  only sequences calls and persists state (see `apps/api/src/jobs/runner.ts`).
- Run `pnpm --filter @dgipr/poster-renderer exec playwright install chromium` once
  per machine — the poster renderer needs a local Chromium for the API process too.
